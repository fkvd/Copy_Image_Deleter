# Copy Image Deleter  

Copy Image Deleter (*CID*) deletes the same images which are in the same directory.  
You can use CID in both windows and linux.  
  

## Usage  

Linux: you can type `python3 CID.py` in terminal.  
Windows: you can type `python CID.py` in the command line or you can run the executable file.

Note: Since the program deletes copy images, some antivirus programs give a warning and close the program. So you may need to disable antivirus.   
  

After opening the program, select the image extension. Then select the folder that contains possible copy images. It might take a while. Please be patient :)
